##Flu

* [Google Flu Trends](https://www.google.org/flutrends/us/#US)

  * [Data](https://www.google.org/flutrends/us/data.txt) dms_note: might be one of the better/most easily accessible data source. 

* [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](http://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.htm)

  * [Vaccination Coverage](http://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/reports/reporti1314/trends/index.htm) dms_note: might be best source for vaccination information. 
  * [Flu activity](http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluactivitysurv.htm) dms_note: by state at its finest geographic level it appears at first look. I'll try and dig a little on this. I'm not that well-versed in the different strains of flu so might be useful for that. 

* [Flu Near You - partnership between HealthMap (healthmap.org) at Boston Childrenâ€™s Hospital, the American Public Health Association (APHA, apha.org) and the Skoll Global Threats Fund (skollglobalthreats.org)](https://flunearyou.org) dms_note: not sure how I feel about this site yet. Not sure how many users/contributing data it has.
